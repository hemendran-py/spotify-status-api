## Authorization
This API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. To run this, you will need the following Spotify credentials:

- Client ID
- Client Secret
- Refresh Token (You can use Postman to complete the OAuth 2.0 flow with Spotify and obtain a refresh token.)

### Getting the Refresh Token
To get the refresh token, follow these steps:
- Go to Spotify's Developer Dashboard and create a new application.
- Use Postman or a similar tool to authenticate via OAuth 2.0 with Spotify, and get the access token and refresh token.
- You can follow this Postman OAuth 2.0 tutorial ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N34BM2CU_3g ) for a step-by-step guide on how to complete the OAuth 2.0 flow and retrieve the tokens.

## How to Integrate this into Your Website  ðŸš€

**STEP 1: Add Credentials**    
 
Add your own Spotify Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token into a `.env` file in your project.  

**STEP 2: Copy the API Folder**  

If you are using Next.js 13 (or a similar framework that uses a similar folder structure), copy the `api` folder from this repository into the `app` folder of your Next.js project. This folder contains the backend code for interacting with the Spotify API.    

**STEP 3: Integrate API Functions into Your Website**  

+ add authorization credentials and refresh token("how to get" mentioned in the beginning) in the `.env` file
+ Create a `recent-track.js` file in `components` folder of your project.  
+ copy content from `page.js` from this repository and paste it in your `recent-track.js` file.
+ now import the component in the page where you want the recently played tab to be in.
  ```
  import spotify from '../components/recent-track.js';
  ```
+ and use the component wherever you want in that page!! </br>
  example:</br>

This will allow you to use the backend API to fetch the currently playing or recently played songs from a Spotify account and display them on your site.
